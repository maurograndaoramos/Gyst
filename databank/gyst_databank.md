# Gyst Project Databank

This document serves as a centralized databank for the Gyst project, summarizing key information from the project context and implementation guide.

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1. Elevator Pitch
"Gyst is your team's AI-native documentation brain. It reads your internal docs like a codebase, automatically tags and cross-references them, and helps resolve issues faster through intelligent search and conversational AIâ€”without anyone digging through folders. 'That's the Gyst of it'."

### 1.2. Core Capabilities
-   **Smart AI Tagging**: Automatically analyzes and tags incident reports, technical documentation, and troubleshooting guides using CrewAI framework with Google Gemini 2.0 API.
-   **Intelligent Pattern Recognition**: Uses sophisticated AI analysis to detect similar past issues and links directly to previous docs with confidence scoring and relevance ranking.
-   **Advanced Conversational Interface**: Teams can chat with Gyst using natural language; it responds by analyzing document content in real-time and pulling up relevant information with source attribution.
-   **Multi-Format Document Support**: Seamlessly handles .txt, .md, .pdf, and .docx files with specialized processing for each format.
-   **Role-Based Knowledge Management**: Supports different user roles (Admin for content management, User for consumption) within organizations.

### 1.3. Target Users
-   DevOps teams dealing with recurring infrastructure issues.
-   Support teams triaging technical problems.
-   Engineering organizations transforming tribal knowledge into searchable insights.
-   Technical teams where "didn't we deal with this already?" happens too often.
-   Organizations scaling rapidly who need to ensure knowledge retention.

## 2. System Architecture

## 10. Git Workflow

When we take a card from Kanban, we then clone the project from Github. Then we move to the Dev branch and from there, we create a new branch. The branch should be named "feature/US<User story ID><name-of-the-feature>".
We then develop.
Once we are happy with the results, we push to remote with that new branch.
Our commits comments should reflect what's on branch name. So, "feature/US<User story ID><name-of-the-feature>" should have the following commit comment: "Feature: Adding This and That and doing so and so"
