## Issues to Address:

### 1. __Document Context Specialist Called Twice__

Looking at the logs, I can see:

- First call: Document Context Specialist analyzes documents (legitimate)
- Second call: Document Context Specialist answers "Should I ask the user to provide the document again?" (redundant)

This suggests the AI Assistant agent is making an unnecessary consultation with the Document Context Specialist via the "Ask question to coworker" tool.

### 2. __Incorrect Document Path Resolution__

The error shows: `8e59b3ed-96c6-40e3-b0e2-638985502eb6/5be4f4751f8b289c.md` This needs to be resolved using the proper upload path from settings.py.

Let me check the current settings and chat service implementation to plan the fixes:

## Plan to Fix:

### __Issue #1: Redundant Agent Calls__

__Root Cause__: The AI Assistant agent is unnecessarily consulting the Document Context Specialist through the "Ask question to coworker" tool for simple decisions it should make itself.

__Solution__:

- Modify the AI Assistant agent's prompt/logic to be more self-sufficient for basic decisions
- Remove or restrict the "Ask question to coworker" tool usage for simple cases
- The AI Assistant should be able to determine on its own whether to ask for a document

### __Issue #2: Document Path Resolution__

__Root Cause__: The @ mention feature is passing relative paths that don't match the actual file system structure.

__Solution__:

- Check `settings.py` for the correct upload path configuration
- Update the chat service's document path resolution logic
- Ensure document paths from our @ mention system are correctly formatted
- Add proper path validation before passing to CrewAI

### __Issue #3: Rate Limiting (Future Prevention)__

While you're currently hitting free tier limits, we should also implement:

- Better error handling for rate limits
- Exponential backoff retry logic
- Request queuing system

Let me examine the current settings.py and chat service to understand the correct path structure, then provide specific fixes.
